        <h2>My Family</h2>
        <p> I live with my mom and have 2 brothers and 1 sister. 
            I have and aunt and cousin as well. In other state where my grandpa live I have 
            multiple cousins there to. My mom takes me to all of my basketball games and practices.
            When my mom can't take me my aunt steps up and takes to the game. My family is spread out all over the world.
            So the family that lives close together we stick together like glue. Our parents always tell us to stick together and get along becasue this is all we
            have. We hate each other most of the time but in the end we together and help each other.
